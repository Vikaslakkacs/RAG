To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL:First-class streaming support\\nWhen you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens.Async support\\nAny chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a LangServe server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server.Optimized parallel execution\\nWhenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents from multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency.Retries and fallbacks\\nConfigure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains more reliable at scale. We’re currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added reliability without any latency cost.Access intermediate results\\nFor more complex chains it’s often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even before the final output is produced. This can be used to let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your chain. You can stream intermediate results, and it’s available on every LangServe server.Input and output schemas\\nInput and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from the structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe.Seamless LangSmith tracing\\nAs your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what exactly is happening at every step.\\nWith LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and debuggability.Seamless LangServe deployment\\nAny chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using LangServe.Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousWeb scrapingNextGet startedCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together.', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

It runs all of its values in parallel, and each value is called with the overall input of the RunnableParallel. The final return value is a dict with the results of each value under its appropriate key.It is useful for parallelizing operations, but can also be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence.Here the input to prompt is expected to be a map with keys \"context\" and \"question\". The user input is just the question.

The output of the previous runnable\\'s .invoke() call is passed as input to the next runnable. This can be done using the pipe operator (|), or the more explicit .pipe() method, which does the same thing. The resulting RunnableSequence is itself a runnable, which means it can be invoked, streamed, or piped just like any other runnable.📄️ Parallel: Format dataThe RunnableParallel primitive is essentially a dict whose values are runnables (or things that can be coerced to runnables, like functions). It runs all of its values in parallel, and each value is called with the overall input of the RunnableParallel. The final return value is a dict with the results of each value under its appropriate key.📄️ Binding: Attach runtime argsSometimes we want to invoke a Runnable within a Runnable sequence with constant arguments that are not part of the output of the preceding Runnable in the sequence, and which are not part of the user input. We can use Runnable.bind() to pass these arguments in.📄️ Lambda: Run custom functionsYou can use arbitrary functions in the pipeline.📄️ Passthrough: Pass through inputsRunnablePassthrough on its own allows you to pass inputs unchanged. This typically is used in conjuction with RunnableParallel to pass data through to a new key in the map.📄️ Assign: Add values to stateThe RunnablePassthrough.assign(...) static method takes an input value and adds the extra arguments passed to the assign function.📄️ Configure runtime chain internalsOftentimes you may want to experiment with, or even expose to the end user, multiple different ways of doing things.Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousRunnable interfaceNextSequences: Chaining runnablesCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/primitives/', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'Primitives | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'In addition to various components that are usable with LCEL, LangChain also includes various primitives', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

These methods are designed to stream the final output in chunks, yielding each chunk as soon as it is available.Streaming is only possible if all steps in the program know how to process an input stream; i.e., process an input chunk one at a time, and yield a corresponding output chunk.The complexity of this processing can vary, from straightforward tasks like emitting tokens produced by an LLM, to more challenging ones like streaming parts of JSON results before the entire JSON is complete.The best place to start exploring streaming is with the single most important components in LLMs apps-- the LLMs themselves!LLMs and Chat Models\\u200bLarge language models and their chat variants are the primary bottleneck in LLM based apps. 🙊Large language models can take several seconds to generate a complete response to a query. This is far slower than the ~200-300 ms threshold at which an application feels responsive to an end user.The key strategy to make the application feel more responsive is to show intermediate progress; viz., to stream the output from the model token by token.We will show examples of streaming using the chat model from Anthropic. To use the model, you will need to install the langchain-anthropic package. You can do this with the following command:pip install -qU langchain-anthropic# Showing the example using anthropic, but you can use# your favorite chat model!from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicmodel = ChatAnthropic()chunks = []async for chunk in model.astream(\"hello. tell me something about yourself\"):    chunks.append(chunk)    print(chunk.content, end=\"|\", flush=True) Hello|!| My| name| is| Claude|.| I|\\'m| an| AI| assistant| created| by| An|throp|ic| to| be| helpful|,| harmless|,| and| honest|.||Let\\'s inspect one of the chunkschunks[0]AIMessageChunk(content=\\' Hello\\')We got back something called an AIMessageChunk. This chunk represents a part of an AIMessage.Message chunks are additive by design -- one can simply add them up to get the state of the response so far!chunks[0] + chunks[1] + chunks[2] + chunks[3] + chunks[4]AIMessageChunk(content=\\' Hello! My name is\\')Chains\\u200bVirtually all LLM applications involve more steps than just a call to a language model.Let\\'s build a simple chain using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) that combines a prompt, model and a parser and verify that streaming works.We will use StrOutputParser to parse the output from the model. This is a simple parser that extracts the content field from an AIMessageChunk, giving us the token returned by the model.tipLCEL is a declarative way to specify a \"program\" by chainining together different LangChain primitives. Chains created using LCEL benefit from an automatic implementation of stream and astream allowing streaming of the final output. In fact, chains created with LCEL implement the entire standard Runnable interface.from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplateprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"tell me a joke about {topic}\")parser = StrOutputParser()chain = prompt | model | parserasync for chunk in chain.astream({\"topic\": \"parrot\"}):    print(chunk, end=\"|\", flush=True) Here|\\'s| a| silly| joke| about| a| par|rot|:|What| kind| of| teacher| gives| good| advice|?| An| ap|-|parent| (|app|arent|)| one|!||You might notice above that parser actually doesn\\'t block the streaming output from the model, and instead processes each chunk individually. Many of the LCEL primitives also support this kind of transform-style passthrough streaming, which can be very convenient when constructing apps.Certain runnables, like prompt templates and chat models, cannot process individual chunks and instead aggregate all previous steps. This will interrupt the streaming process. Custom functions can be designed to return generators, whichnoteIf the above functionality is not relevant to what you\\'re building, you do not have to use the LangChain Expression Language to use LangChain and can instead rely on a standard imperative programming approach by\\ncaling invoke, batch or stream on each component individually, assigning the results to variables and then using them downstream as you see fit.If that works for your needs, then that\\'s fine by us 👌!Working with Input Streams\\u200bWhat if you wanted to stream JSON from the output as it was being generated?If you were to rely on json.loads to parse the partial json, the parsing would fail as the partial json wouldn\\'t be valid json.You\\'d likely be at a complete loss of what to do and claim that it wasn\\'t possible to stream JSON.Well, turns out there is a way to do it -- the parser needs to operate on the input stream, and attempt to \"auto-complete\" the partial json into a valid state.Let\\'s see such a parser in action to understand what this means.from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParserchain = (    model | JsonOutputParser())  # Due to a bug in older versions of Langchain, JsonOutputParser did not stream results from some modelsasync for text in chain.astream(    \\'output a list of the countries france, spain and japan and their populations in JSON format.

We\\'ll use the previous example and append an extraction function at the end that extracts the country names from the finalized JSON.dangerAny steps in the chain that operate on finalized inputs rather than on input streams can break streaming functionality via stream or astream.tipLater, we will discuss the astream_events API which streams results from intermediate steps. This API will stream results from intermediate steps even if the chain contains steps that only operate on finalized inputs.from langchain_core.output_parsers import (    JsonOutputParser,)# A function that operates on finalized inputs# rather than on an input_streamdef _extract_country_names(inputs):    \"\"\"A function that does not operates on input streams and breaks streaming.\"\"\"    if not isinstance(inputs, dict):        return \"\"    if \"countries\" not in inputs:        return \"\"    countries = inputs[\"countries\"]    if not isinstance(countries, list):        return \"\"    country_names = [        country.get(\"name\") for country in countries if isinstance(country, dict)    ]    return country_nameschain = model | JsonOutputParser() | _extract_country_namesasync for text in chain.astream(    \\'output a list of the countries france, spain and japan and their populations in JSON format.

Not all components have to implement streaming -- in some cases streaming is either unnecessary, difficult or just doesn\\'t make sense.tipAn LCEL chain constructed using non-streaming components, will still be able to stream in a lot of cases, with streaming of partial output starting after the last non-streaming step in the chain.retrieval_chain = (    {        \"context\": retriever.with_config(run_name=\"Docs\"),        \"question\": RunnablePassthrough(),    }    | prompt    | model    | StrOutputParser())for chunk in retrieval_chain.stream(    \"Where did harrison work? \" \"Write 3 made up sentences about this place.\"):    print(chunk, end=\"|\", flush=True) Based| on| the| given| context|,| the| only| information| provided| about| where| Harrison| worked| is| that| he| worked| at| Ken|sh|o|.| Since| there| are| no| other| details| provided| about| Ken|sh|o|,| I| do| not| have| enough| information| to| write| 3| additional| made| up| sentences| about| this| place|.| I| can| only| state| that| Harrison| worked| at| Ken|sh|o|.||Now that we\\'ve seen how stream and astream work, let\\'s venture into the world of streaming events. 🏞️Using Stream Events\\u200bEvent Streaming is a beta API.

Routing helps provide structure and consistency around interactions with LLMs.There are two ways to perform routing:Conditionally return runnables from a RunnableLambda (recommended)Using a RunnableBranch.We\\'ll illustrate both methods using a two step sequence where the first step classifies an input question as being about LangChain, Anthropic, or Other, then routes to a corresponding prompt chain.Example Setup\\u200bFirst, let\\'s create a chain that will identify incoming questions as being about LangChain, Anthropic, or Other:from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatechain = (    PromptTemplate.from_template(        \"\"\"Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.Do not respond with more than one word.<question>{question}</question>Classification:\"\"\"    )    | ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")    | StrOutputParser())chain.invoke({\"question\": \"how do I call Anthropic?\"})\\'Anthropic\\'Now, let\\'s create three sub chains:langchain_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"\"\"You are an expert in langchain. \\\\Always answer questions starting with \"As Harrison Chase told me\". \\\\Respond to the following question:Question: {question}Answer:\"\"\") | ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")anthropic_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"\"\"You are an expert in anthropic. \\\\Always answer questions starting with \"As Dario Amodei told me\". \\\\Respond to the following question:Question: {question}Answer:\"\"\") | ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")general_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"\"\"Respond to the following question:Question: {question}Answer:\"\"\") | ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")Using a custom function (Recommended)\\u200bYou can also use a custom function to route between different outputs. Here\\'s an example:def route(info):    if \"anthropic\" in info[\"topic\"].lower():        return anthropic_chain    elif \"langchain\" in info[\"topic\"].lower():        return langchain_chain    else:        return general_chainfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambdafull_chain = {\"topic\": chain, \"question\": lambda x: x[\"question\"]} | RunnableLambda(    route)full_chain.invoke({\"question\": \"how do I use Anthropic?\"})AIMessage(content=\"As Dario Amodei told me, to use Anthropic, you can start by exploring the company\\'s website and learning about their mission, values, and the different services and products they offer.

It does not offer anything that you can\\'t achieve in a custom function as described above, so we recommend using a custom function instead.A RunnableBranch is initialized with a list of (condition, runnable) pairs and a default runnable. It selects which branch by passing each condition the input it\\'s invoked with. It selects the first condition to evaluate to True, and runs the corresponding runnable to that condition with the input. If no provided conditions match, it runs the default runnable.Here\\'s an example of what it looks like in action:from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranchbranch = RunnableBranch(    (lambda x: \"anthropic\" in x[\"topic\"].lower(), anthropic_chain),    (lambda x: \"langchain\" in x[\"topic\"].lower(), langchain_chain),    general_chain,)full_chain = {\"topic\": chain, \"question\": lambda x: x[\"question\"]} | branchfull_chain.invoke({\"question\": \"how do I use Anthropic?\"})AIMessage(content=\"As Dario Amodei told me, to use Anthropic, you should first familiarize yourself with our mission and principles.

This means that if you were to get too close to a black hole, you would be pulled in and crushed by the intense gravitational forces.The formation of a black hole occurs when a massive star, much larger than our Sun, reaches the end of its life and collapses in on itself. This collapse causes the matter to become extremely dense, and the gravitational force becomes so strong that it creates a point of no return, known as the event horizon.Beyond the event horizon, the laws of physics as we know them break down, and the intense gravitational forces create a singularity, which is a point of infinite density and curvature in space-time.Black holes are fascinating and mysterious objects, and there is still much to be learned about their properties and behavior. If I were unsure about any specific details or aspects of black holes, I would readily admit that I do not have a complete understanding and would encourage further research and investigation.print(chain.invoke(\"What\\'s a path integral\"))Using MATHA path integral is a powerful mathematical concept in physics, particularly in the field of quantum mechanics. It was developed by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman as an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.In a path integral, instead of considering a single, definite path that a particle might take from one point to another, as in classical mechanics, the particle is considered to take all possible paths simultaneously. Each path is assigned a complex-valued weight, and the total probability amplitude for the particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing (integrating) over all possible paths.The key ideas behind the path integral formulation are:1. Superposition principle: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition of multiple states or paths simultaneously.2. Probability amplitude: The probability amplitude for a particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing the complex-valued weights of all possible paths.3. Weighting of paths: Each path is assigned a weight based on the action (the time integral of the Lagrangian) along that path. Paths with lower action have a greater weight.4. Feynman\\'s approach: Feynman developed the path integral formulation as an alternative to the traditional wave function approach in quantum mechanics, providing a more intuitive and conceptual understanding of quantum phenomena.The path integral approach is particularly useful in quantum field theory, where it provides a powerful framework for calculating transition probabilities and understanding the behavior of quantum systems. It has also found applications in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and even in finance (the path integral approach to option pricing).The mathematical construction of the path integral involves the use of advanced concepts from functional analysis and measure theory, making it a powerful and sophisticated tool in the physicist\\'s arsenal.Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousAdd message history (memory)NextInspect your runnablesExample SetupUsing a custom function (Recommended)Using a RunnableBranchCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/routing/', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'Route logic based on input | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'This notebook covers how to do routing in the LangChain Expression Language.', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

The officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 46 presidencies. The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president. The incumbent president is Joe Biden.The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.Page: List of presidents of the United States by ageSummary: In this list of presidents of the United States by age, the first table charts the age of each president of the United States at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the president is still living, their lifespan and post-presidency timespan are calculated up to January 25, 2024.Page: List of vice presidents of the United StatesSummary: There have been 49 vice presidents of the United States since the office was created in 1789. Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second-most votes for president in the Electoral College. But after the election of 1800 produced a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, requiring the House of Representatives to choose between them, lawmakers acted to prevent such a situation from recurring. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1804, creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency.The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession—that is, they assume the presidency if the president dies, resigns, or is impeached and removed from office. Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way: eight (John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson) through the president\\'s death and one (Gerald Ford) through the president\\'s resignation. The vice president also serves as the president of the Senate and may choose to cast a tie-breaking vote on decisions made by the Senate. Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years.Before adoption of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president could not be filled until the next post-election inauguration. Several such vacancies occurred: seven vice presidents died, one resigned and eight succeeded to the presidency. This amendment allowed for a vacancy to be filled through appointment by the president and confirmation by both chambers of the Congress. Since its ratification, the vice presidency has been vacant twice (both in the context of scandals surrounding the Nixon administration) and was filled both times through this process, namely in 1973 following Spiro Agnew\\'s resignation, and again in 1974 after Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency. The amendment also established a procedure whereby a vice president may, if the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, temporarily assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president. Three vice presidents have briefly acted as president under the 25th Amendment: George H. W. Bush on July 13, 1985; Dick Cheney on June 29, 2002, and on July 21, 2007; and Kamala Harris on November 19, 2021.The persons who have served as vice president were born in or primarily affiliated with 27 states plus the District of Columbia. New York has produced the most of any state as eight have been born there and three others considered it their home state. Most vice presidents have been in their 50s or 60s and had political experience before assuming the office. Two vice presidents—George Clinton and John C. Calhoun—served under more than one president. Ill with tuberculosis and recovering in Cuba on Inauguration Day in 1853, William R. King, by an Act of Congress, was allowed to take the oath outside the United States. He is the only vice president to take his oath of office in a foreign country.Page: List of presidents of the United States by net worthSummary: The list of presidents of the United States by net worth at peak varies greatly. Debt and depreciation often means that presidents\\' net worth is less than $0 at the time of death. Most presidents before 1845 were extremely wealthy, especially Andrew Jackson and George Washington.    Presidents since 1929, when Herbert Hoover took office, have generally been wealthier than presidents of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; with the exception of Harry S. Truman, all presidents since this time have been millionaires. These presidents have often received income from autobiographies and other writing. Except for Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy (both of whom died while in office), all presidents beginning with Calvin Coolidge have written autobiographies. In addition, many presidents—including Bill Clinton—have earned considerable income from public speaking after leaving office.The richest president in history may be Donald Trump. However, his net worth is not precisely known because the Trump Organization is privately held.Truman was among the poorest U.S. presidents, with a net worth considerably less than $1 million. His financial situation contributed to the doubling of the presidential salary to $100,000 in 1949. In addition, the presidential pension was created in 1958 when Truman was again experiencing financial difficulties. Harry and Bess Truman received the first Medicare cards in 1966 via the Social Security Act of 1965.Page: List of presidents of the United States by home stateSummary: These lists give the states of primary affiliation and of birth for each president of the United States.\\x1b[0m\\x1b[32;1m\\x1b[1;3mInvoking: `Wikipedia` with `Joe Biden`\\x1b[0m\\x1b[36;1m\\x1b[1;3mPage: Joe BidenSummary: Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (  BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history, and the first to have a female vice president.As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America\\'s membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced military support for Israel, and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism. In April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election.Page: Presidency of Joe BidenSummary: Joe Biden\\'s tenure as the 46th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2021. Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who previously served as vice president for two terms under president Barack Obama, took office following his victory in the 2020 presidential election over Republican incumbent president Donald Trump. Biden won the presidency with a popular vote of over 81 million, the highest number of votes cast for a single United States presidential candidate. Upon his inauguration, he became the oldest president in American history, breaking the record set by his predecessor Trump. Biden entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic crisis, and increased political polarization.On the first day of his presidency, Biden made an effort to revert President Trump\\'s energy policy by restoring U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement and revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also halted funding for Trump\\'s border wall, an expansion of the Mexican border wall. On his second day, he issued a series of executive orders to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, and set an early goal of achieving one hundred million COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in his first 100 days.Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID-19. He signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; a ten-year plan brokered by Biden alongside Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access. Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, making Juneteenth a federal holiday in the United States. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court—the first Black woman to serve on the court. After The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Biden took executive actions, such as the signing of Executive Order 14076, to preserve and protect women\\'s health rights nationwide, against abortion bans in Republican led states. Biden proposed a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net through the Build Back Better Act, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. However, in August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a domestic appropriations bill that included some of the provisions of the Build Back Better Act after the entire bill failed to pass. It included significant federal investment in climate and domestic clean energy production, tax credits for solar panels, electric cars and other home energy programs as well as a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The administration\\'s economic policies, known as \"Bidenomics\", were inspired and designed by Trickle-up economics. Described as growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up and growing the middle class. Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, bolstering the semiconductor and manufacturing industry, the Honoring our PACT Act, expanding health care for US veterans, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. In late 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and codified same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States. In response to the debt-ceiling crisis of 2023, Biden negotiated and signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which restrains federal spending for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, implements minor changes to SNAP and TANF, includes energy permitting reform, claws back some IRS funding and unspent money for COVID-19, and suspends the debt ceiling to January 1, 2025. Biden established the American Climate Corps and created the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. On September 26, 2023, Joe Biden visited a United Auto Workers picket line during the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, making him the first US president to visit one.The foreign policy goal of the Biden administration is to restore the US to a \"position of trusted leadership\" among global democracies in order to address the challenges posed by Russia and China. In foreign policy, Biden completed the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, declaring an end to nation-building efforts and shifting U.S. foreign policy toward strategic competition with China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. However, during the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, leading to Biden receiving bipartisan criticism. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia as well as providing Ukraine with over $100 billion in combined military, economic, and humanitarian aid. Biden also approved a raid which led to the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the leader of the Islamic State, and approved a drone strike which killed Ayman Al Zawahiri, leader of Al-Qaeda. Biden signed and created AUKUS, an international security alliance, together with Australia and the United Kingdom. Biden called for the expansion of NATO with the addition of Finland and Sweden, and rallied NATO allies in support of Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism and announced American military support for Israel; Biden also showed his support and sympathy towards Palestinians affected by the war, sent humanitarian aid, and brokered a four-day temporary pause and hostage exchange.Page: Family of Joe BidenSummary: Joe Biden, the 46th and current president of the United States, has family members who are prominent in law, education, activism and politics. Biden\\'s immediate family became the first family of the United States on his inauguration on January 20, 2021. His immediate family circle was also the second family of the United States from 2009 to 2017, when Biden was vice president.

It borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state\\'s name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia\\'s first colonial-era governor.Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the 2nd smallest and 6th least populous state, but also the 6th most densely populated. Delaware\\'s most populous city is Wilmington, and the state\\'s capital is Dover, the 2nd most populous city in Delaware. The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S. states; from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County.The southern two counties, Kent and Sussex counties, historically have been predominantly agrarian economies. New Castle is more urbanized and is considered part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan statistical area that surrounds and includes Philadelphia, the nation\\'s 6th most populous city. Delaware is considered part of the Southern United States by the U.S. Census Bureau, but the state\\'s geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country.Before Delaware coastline was explored and developed by Europeans in the 16th century, the state was inhabited by several Native Americans tribes, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. The state was first colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near present-day Lewes, Delaware, in 1631.Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that participated in the American Revolution and American Revolutionary War, in which the American Continental Army, led by George Washington, defeated the British, ended British colonization and establishing the United States as a sovereign and independent nation.On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, earning it the nickname \"The First State\".Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware has become an onshore corporate haven whose corporate laws are deemed appealing to corporations; over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed corporations and over three-fifths of the Fortune 500 is legally incorporated in the state.Page: Delaware City, DelawareSummary: Delaware City is a city in New Castle County, Delaware, United States. The population was 1,885 as of 2020. It is a small port town on the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and is the location of the Forts Ferry Crossing to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island.Page: Delaware RiverSummary: The Delaware River is a major river in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and is the longest free-flowing (undammed) river in the Eastern United States. From the meeting of its branches in Hancock, New York, the river flows for 282 miles (454 km) along the borders of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, before emptying into Delaware Bay.The river has been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation as one of the country\\'s Great Waters and has been called the \"Lifeblood of the Northeast\" by American Rivers. Its watershed drains an area of 13,539 square miles (35,070 km2) and provides drinking water for 17 million people, including half of New York City via the Delaware Aqueduct.The Delaware River has two branches that rise in the Catskill Mountains of New York: the West Branch at Mount Jefferson in Jefferson, Schoharie County, and the East Branch at Grand Gorge, Delaware County. The branches merge to form the main Delaware River at Hancock, New York. Flowing south, the river remains relatively undeveloped, with 152 miles (245 km) protected as the Upper, Middle, and Lower Delaware National Scenic Rivers. At Trenton, New Jersey, the Delaware becomes tidal, navigable, and significantly more industrial. This section forms the backbone of the Delaware Valley metropolitan area, serving the port cities of Philadelphia, Camden, New Jersey, and Wilmington, Delaware. The river flows into Delaware Bay at Liston Point, 48 miles (77 km) upstream of the bay\\'s outlet to the Atlantic Ocean between Cape May and Cape Henlopen.Before the arrival of European settlers, the river was the homeland of the Lenape native people. They called the river Lenapewihittuk, or Lenape River, and Kithanne, meaning the largest river in this part of the country.In 1609, the river was visited by a Dutch East India Company expedition led by Henry Hudson. Hudson, an English navigator, was hired to find a western route to Cathay (China), but his encounters set the stage for Dutch colonization of North America in the 17th century. Early Dutch and Swedish settlements were established along the lower section of the river and Delaware Bay. Both colonial powers called the river the South River (Zuidrivier), compared to the Hudson River, which was known as the North River. After the English expelled the Dutch and took control of the New Netherland colony in 1664, the river was renamed Delaware after Sir Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Virginia colony\\'s first royal governor, who defended the colony during the First Anglo-Powhatan War.Page: University of DelawareSummary: The University of Delaware (colloquially known as UD or Delaware) is a privately governed, state-assisted land-grant research university located in Newark, Delaware. UD is the largest university in Delaware. It offers three associate\\'s programs, 148 bachelor\\'s programs, 121 master\\'s programs (with 13 joint degrees), and 55 doctoral programs across its eight colleges. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is considered a large institution with approximately 18,200 undergraduate and 4,200 graduate students. It is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant state-supported research institution.UD is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". According to the National Science Foundation, UD spent $186 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 119th in the nation.  It is recognized with the Community Engagement Classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.UD students, alumni, and sports teams are known as the \"Fightin\\' Blue Hens\", more commonly shortened to \"Blue Hens\", and the school colors are Delaware blue and gold. UD sponsors 21 men\\'s and women\\'s NCAA Division-I sports teams and have competed in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) since 2001.Page: LenapeSummary: The Lenape (English: , , ; Lenape languages: [lənaːpe]), also called the Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an Indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in the United States and Canada.The Lenape\\'s historical territory includes present-day northeastern Delaware, all of New Jersey, the eastern Pennsylvania regions of the Lehigh Valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and New York Bay, western Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley in New York state. Today they are based in Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Ontario.During the last decades of the 18th century, European settlers and the effects of the American Revolutionary War displaced most Lenape from their homelands and pushed them north and west. In the 1860s, under the Indian removal policy, the U.S. federal government relocated most Lenape remaining in the Eastern United States to the Indian Territory and surrounding regions. Lenape people currently belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge–Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario.\\x1b[0m---------------------------------------------------------------------------``````outputBadRequestError                           Traceback (most recent call last)``````outputCell In[11], line 14      1 agent = (      2     {      3         \"input\": itemgetter(\"input\"),   (...)     10     | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser()     11 )     13 agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)---> 14 agent_executor.invoke(     15     {     16         \"input\": \"Who is the current US president?

The officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 46 presidencies. The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president. The incumbent president is Joe Biden.The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.Page: List of presidents of the United States by ageSummary: In this list of presidents of the United States by age, the first table charts the age of each president of the United States at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the president is still living, their lifespan and post-presidency timespan are calculated up to January 25, 2024.Page: List of vice presidents of the United StatesSummary: There have been 49 vice presidents of the United States since the office was created in 1789. Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second-most votes for president in the Electoral College. But after the election of 1800 produced a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, requiring the House of Representatives to choose between them, lawmakers acted to prevent such a situation from recurring. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1804, creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency.The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession—that is, they assume the presidency if the president dies, resigns, or is impeached and removed from office. Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way: eight (John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson) through the president\\'s death and one (Gerald Ford) through the president\\'s resignation. The vice president also serves as the president of the Senate and may choose to cast a tie-breaking vote on decisions made by the Senate. Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years.Before adoption of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, an intra-term vacancy in the office of the vice president could not be filled until the next post-election inauguration. Several such vacancies occurred: seven vice presidents died, one resigned and eight succeeded to the presidency. This amendment allowed for a vacancy to be filled through appointment by the president and confirmation by both chambers of the Congress. Since its ratification, the vice presidency has been vacant twice (both in the context of scandals surrounding the Nixon administration) and was filled both times through this process, namely in 1973 following Spiro Agnew\\'s resignation, and again in 1974 after Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency. The amendment also established a procedure whereby a vice president may, if the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, temporarily assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president. Three vice presidents have briefly acted as president under the 25th Amendment: George H. W. Bush on July 13, 1985; Dick Cheney on June 29, 2002, and on July 21, 2007; and Kamala Harris on November 19, 2021.The persons who have served as vice president were born in or primarily affiliated with 27 states plus the District of Columbia. New York has produced the most of any state as eight have been born there and three others considered it their home state. Most vice presidents have been in their 50s or 60s and had political experience before assuming the office. Two vice presidents—George Clinton and John C. Calhoun—served under more than one president. Ill with tuberculosis and recovering in Cuba on Inauguration Day in 1853, William R. King, by an Act of Congress, was allowed to take the oath outside the United States. He is the only vice president to take his oath of office in a foreign country.Page: List of presidents of the United States by net worthSummary: The list of presidents of the United States by net worth at peak varies greatly. Debt and depreciation often means that presidents\\' net worth is less than $0 at the time of death. Most presidents before 1845 were extremely wealthy, especially Andrew Jackson and George Washington.    Presidents since 1929, when Herbert Hoover took office, have generally been wealthier than presidents of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; with the exception of Harry S. Truman, all presidents since this time have been millionaires. These presidents have often received income from autobiographies and other writing. Except for Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy (both of whom died while in office), all presidents beginning with Calvin Coolidge have written autobiographies. In addition, many presidents—including Bill Clinton—have earned considerable income from public speaking after leaving office.The richest president in history may be Donald Trump. However, his net worth is not precisely known because the Trump Organization is privately held.Truman was among the poorest U.S. presidents, with a net worth considerably less than $1 million. His financial situation contributed to the doubling of the presidential salary to $100,000 in 1949. In addition, the presidential pension was created in 1958 when Truman was again experiencing financial difficulties. Harry and Bess Truman received the first Medicare cards in 1966 via the Social Security Act of 1965.Page: List of presidents of the United States by home stateSummary: These lists give the states of primary affiliation and of birth for each president of the United States.\\x1b[0m\\x1b[32;1m\\x1b[1;3mInvoking: `Wikipedia` with `Joe Biden`\\x1b[0m\\x1b[36;1m\\x1b[1;3mPage: Joe BidenSummary: Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (  BY-dən; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and he was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. He became the oldest president in U.S. history, and the first to have a female vice president.As president, Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recession. He signed bipartisan bills on infrastructure and manufacturing. He proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that he signed into law in 2022. Biden appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He worked with congressional Republicans to resolve the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America\\'s membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced military support for Israel, and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism. In April 2023, Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election.Page: Presidency of Joe BidenSummary: Joe Biden\\'s tenure as the 46th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2021. Biden, a Democrat from Delaware who previously served as vice president for two terms under president Barack Obama, took office following his victory in the 2020 presidential election over Republican incumbent president Donald Trump. Biden won the presidency with a popular vote of over 81 million, the highest number of votes cast for a single United States presidential candidate. Upon his inauguration, he became the oldest president in American history, breaking the record set by his predecessor Trump. Biden entered office amid the COVID-19 pandemic, an economic crisis, and increased political polarization.On the first day of his presidency, Biden made an effort to revert President Trump\\'s energy policy by restoring U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement and revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. He also halted funding for Trump\\'s border wall, an expansion of the Mexican border wall. On his second day, he issued a series of executive orders to reduce the impact of COVID-19, including invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950, and set an early goal of achieving one hundred million COVID-19 vaccinations in the United States in his first 100 days.Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021; a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that temporarily established expanded unemployment insurance and sent $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans in response to continued economic pressure from COVID-19. He signed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act; a ten-year plan brokered by Biden alongside Democrats and Republicans in Congress, to invest in American roads, bridges, public transit, ports and broadband access. Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, making Juneteenth a federal holiday in the United States. He appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court—the first Black woman to serve on the court. After The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Biden took executive actions, such as the signing of Executive Order 14076, to preserve and protect women\\'s health rights nationwide, against abortion bans in Republican led states. Biden proposed a significant expansion of the U.S. social safety net through the Build Back Better Act, but those efforts, along with voting rights legislation, failed in Congress. However, in August 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a domestic appropriations bill that included some of the provisions of the Build Back Better Act after the entire bill failed to pass. It included significant federal investment in climate and domestic clean energy production, tax credits for solar panels, electric cars and other home energy programs as well as a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The administration\\'s economic policies, known as \"Bidenomics\", were inspired and designed by Trickle-up economics. Described as growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up and growing the middle class. Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, bolstering the semiconductor and manufacturing industry, the Honoring our PACT Act, expanding health care for US veterans, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act. In late 2022, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and codified same-sex and interracial marriage in the United States. In response to the debt-ceiling crisis of 2023, Biden negotiated and signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which restrains federal spending for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, implements minor changes to SNAP and TANF, includes energy permitting reform, claws back some IRS funding and unspent money for COVID-19, and suspends the debt ceiling to January 1, 2025. Biden established the American Climate Corps and created the first ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. On September 26, 2023, Joe Biden visited a United Auto Workers picket line during the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, making him the first US president to visit one.The foreign policy goal of the Biden administration is to restore the US to a \"position of trusted leadership\" among global democracies in order to address the challenges posed by Russia and China. In foreign policy, Biden completed the withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, declaring an end to nation-building efforts and shifting U.S. foreign policy toward strategic competition with China and, to a lesser extent, Russia. However, during the withdrawal, the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control, leading to Biden receiving bipartisan criticism. He responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia as well as providing Ukraine with over $100 billion in combined military, economic, and humanitarian aid. Biden also approved a raid which led to the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the leader of the Islamic State, and approved a drone strike which killed Ayman Al Zawahiri, leader of Al-Qaeda. Biden signed and created AUKUS, an international security alliance, together with Australia and the United Kingdom. Biden called for the expansion of NATO with the addition of Finland and Sweden, and rallied NATO allies in support of Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Biden condemned Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism and announced American military support for Israel; Biden also showed his support and sympathy towards Palestinians affected by the war, sent humanitarian aid, and brokered a four-day temporary pause and hostage exchange.Page: Family of Joe BidenSummary: Joe Biden, the 46th and current president of the United States, has family members who are prominent in law, education, activism and politics. Biden\\'s immediate family became the first family of the United States on his inauguration on January 20, 2021. His immediate family circle was also the second family of the United States from 2009 to 2017, when Biden was vice president. Biden\\'s family is mostly descended from the British Isles, with most of their ancestors coming from Ireland and England, and a smaller number descending from the French.Of Joe Biden\\'s sixteen great-great-grandparents, ten were born in Ireland. He is descended from the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth. One of Biden\\'s great-great-great-grandfathers was born in Sussex, England, and emigrated to Maryland in the United States by 1820.Page: Inauguration of Joe BidenSummary: The inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States took place on Wednesday, January 20, 2021, marking the start of the four-year term of Joe Biden as president and Kamala Harris as vice president. The 59th presidential inauguration took place on the West Front of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Biden took the presidential oath of office, before which Harris took the vice presidential oath of office.The inauguration took place amidst extraordinary political, public health, economic, and national security crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; outgoing President Donald Trump\\'s attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, which provoked an attack on the United States Capitol on January 6; Trump\\'\\x1b[0m\\x1b[32;1m\\x1b[1;3mInvoking: `Wikipedia` with `Delaware`\\x1b[0m\\x1b[36;1m\\x1b[1;3mPage: DelawareSummary: Delaware (  DEL-ə-wair) is a state in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state\\'s name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia\\'s first colonial-era governor.Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the 2nd smallest and 6th least populous state, but also the 6th most densely populated. Delaware\\'s most populous city is Wilmington, and the state\\'s capital is Dover, the 2nd most populous city in Delaware. The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S. states; from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County.The southern two counties, Kent and Sussex counties, historically have been predominantly agrarian economies. New Castle is more urbanized and is considered part of the Delaware Valley metropolitan statistical area that surrounds and includes Philadelphia, the nation\\'s 6th most populous city. Delaware is considered part of the Southern United States by the U.S. Census Bureau, but the state\\'s geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the country.Before Delaware coastline was explored and developed by Europeans in the 16th century, the state was inhabited by several Native Americans tribes, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. The state was first colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near present-day Lewes, Delaware, in 1631.Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that participated in the American Revolution and American Revolutionary War, in which the American Continental Army, led by George Washington, defeated the British, ended British colonization and establishing the United States as a sovereign and independent nation.On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, earning it the nickname \"The First State\".Since the turn of the 20th century, Delaware has become an onshore corporate haven whose corporate laws are deemed appealing to corporations; over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed corporations and over three-fifths of the Fortune 500 is legally incorporated in the state.Page: Delaware City, DelawareSummary: Delaware City is a city in New Castle County, Delaware, United States. The population was 1,885 as of 2020. It is a small port town on the eastern terminus of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and is the location of the Forts Ferry Crossing to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island.Page: Delaware RiverSummary: The Delaware River is a major river in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and is the longest free-flowing (undammed) river in the Eastern United States. From the meeting of its branches in Hancock, New York, the river flows for 282 miles (454 km) along the borders of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, before emptying into Delaware Bay.The river has been recognized by the National Wildlife Federation as one of the country\\'s Great Waters and has been called the \"Lifeblood of the Northeast\" by American Rivers. Its watershed drains an area of 13,539 square miles (35,070 km2) and provides drinking water for 17 million people, including half of New York City via the Delaware Aqueduct.The Delaware River has two branches that rise in the Catskill Mountains of New York: the West Branch at Mount Jefferson in Jefferson, Schoharie County, and the East Branch at Grand Gorge, Delaware County. The branches merge to form the main Delaware River at Hancock, New York. Flowing south, the river remains relatively undeveloped, with 152 miles (245 km) protected as the Upper, Middle, and Lower Delaware National Scenic Rivers. At Trenton, New Jersey, the Delaware becomes tidal, navigable, and significantly more industrial. This section forms the backbone of the Delaware Valley metropolitan area, serving the port cities of Philadelphia, Camden, New Jersey, and Wilmington, Delaware. The river flows into Delaware Bay at Liston Point, 48 miles (77 km) upstream of the bay\\'s outlet to the Atlantic Ocean between Cape May and Cape Henlopen.Before the arrival of European settlers, the river was the homeland of the Lenape native people. They called the river Lenapewihittuk, or Lenape River, and Kithanne, meaning the largest river in this part of the country.In 1609, the river was visited by a Dutch East India Company expedition led by Henry Hudson. Hudson, an English navigator, was hired to find a western route to Cathay (China), but his encounters set the stage for Dutch colonization of North America in the 17th century. Early Dutch and Swedish settlements were established along the lower section of the river and Delaware Bay. Both colonial powers called the river the South River (Zuidrivier), compared to the Hudson River, which was known as the North River. After the English expelled the Dutch and took control of the New Netherland colony in 1664, the river was renamed Delaware after Sir Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Virginia colony\\'s first royal governor, who defended the colony during the First Anglo-Powhatan War.Page: University of DelawareSummary: The University of Delaware (colloquially known as UD or Delaware) is a privately governed, state-assisted land-grant research university located in Newark, Delaware. UD is the largest university in Delaware. It offers three associate\\'s programs, 148 bachelor\\'s programs, 121 master\\'s programs (with 13 joint degrees), and 55 doctoral programs across its eight colleges. The main campus is in Newark, with satellite campuses in Dover, Wilmington, Lewes, and Georgetown. It is considered a large institution with approximately 18,200 undergraduate and 4,200 graduate students. It is a privately governed university which receives public funding for being a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant state-supported research institution.UD is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". According to the National Science Foundation, UD spent $186 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 119th in the nation.  It is recognized with the Community Engagement Classification by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.UD students, alumni, and sports teams are known as the \"Fightin\\' Blue Hens\", more commonly shortened to \"Blue Hens\", and the school colors are Delaware blue and gold. UD sponsors 21 men\\'s and women\\'s NCAA Division-I sports teams and have competed in the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) since 2001.Page: LenapeSummary: The Lenape (English: , , ; Lenape languages: [lənaːpe]), also called the Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an Indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in the United States and Canada.The Lenape\\'s historical territory includes present-day northeastern Delaware, all of New Jersey, the eastern Pennsylvania regions of the Lehigh Valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and New York Bay, western Long Island, and the lower Hudson Valley in New York state. Today they are based in Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Ontario.During the last decades of the 18th century, European settlers and the effects of the American Revolutionary War displaced most Lenape from their homelands and pushed them north and west. In the 1860s, under the Indian removal policy, the U.S. federal government relocated most Lenape remaining in the Eastern United States to the Indian Territory and surrounding regions. Lenape people currently belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge–Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario.\\x1b[0m\\x1b[32;1m\\x1b[1;3mInvoking: `Wikipedia` with `Blue hen chicken`\\x1b[0m\\x1b[36;1m\\x1b[1;3mPage: Delaware Blue HenSummary: The Delaware Blue Hen or Blue Hen of Delaware is a blue strain of American gamecock.

The Blue Hens compete in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as members of the Coastal Athletic Association and its technically separate football league, CAA Football.On November 28, 2023, UD and Conference USA (CUSA) jointly announced that UD would start a transition to the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) in 2024 and join CUSA in 2025. UD will continue to compete in both sides of the CAA in 2024–25; it will be ineligible for the FCS playoffs due to NCAA rules for transitioning programs, but will be eligible for all non-football CAA championships. Upon joining CUSA, UD will be eligible for all conference championship events except the football championship game; it will become eligible for that event upon completing the FBS transition in 2026. At the same time, UD also announced it would add one women\\'s sport due to Title IX considerations, and would also be seeking conference homes for the seven sports that UD sponsors but CUSA does not. The new women\\'s sport would later be announced as ice hockey; UD will join College Hockey America for its first season of varsity play in 2025–26.Page: Brahma chickenSummary: The Brahma is an American breed of chicken. It was bred in the United States from birds imported from the Chinese port of Shanghai,:\\u200a78\\u200a and was the principal American meat breed from the 1850s until about 1930.Page: SilkieSummary: The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens have only four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm and friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens have been bred to have a wide variety of colors which include but are not limited to: Black, Blue, Buff, Partridge, Splash, White, Lavender, Paint and Porcelain.Page: Silverudd BlueSummary: The Silverudd Blue, Swedish: Silverudds Blå, is a Swedish breed of chicken. It was developed by Martin Silverudd in Småland, in southern Sweden. Hens lay blue/green eggs, weighing 50–65 grams. The flock-book for the breed is kept by the Svenska Kulturhönsföreningen – the Swedish Cultural Hen Association. It was initially known by various names including Isbar, Blue Isbar and Svensk Grönvärpare, or \"Swedish green egg layer\"; in 2016 it was renamed to \\'Silverudd Blue\\' after its creator.\\x1b[0m\\x1b[32;1m\\x1b[1;3mThe current US president is Joe Biden.

In this chain the user input is passed to the prompt template, then the prompt template output is passed to the model, then the model output is passed to the output parser. Let\\'s take a look at each component individually to really understand what\\'s going on.1. Prompt\\u200bprompt is a BasePromptTemplate, which means it takes in a dictionary of template variables and produces a PromptValue. A PromptValue is a wrapper around a completed prompt that can be passed to either an LLM (which takes a string as input) or ChatModel (which takes a sequence of messages as input). It can work with either language model type because it defines logic both for producing BaseMessages and for producing a string.prompt_value = prompt.invoke({\"topic\": \"ice cream\"})prompt_valueChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content=\\'tell me a short joke about ice cream\\')])prompt_value.to_messages()[HumanMessage(content=\\'tell me a short joke about ice cream\\')]prompt_value.to_string()\\'Human: tell me a short joke about ice cream\\'2. Model\\u200bThe PromptValue is then passed to model. In this case our model is a ChatModel, meaning it will output a BaseMessage.message = model.invoke(prompt_value)messageAIMessage(content=\"Why don\\'t ice creams ever get invited to parties?\\\\n\\\\nBecause they always bring a melt down!\")If our model was an LLM, it would output a string.from langchain_openai import OpenAIllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\")llm.invoke(prompt_value)\\'\\\\n\\\\nRobot: Why did the ice cream truck break down? Because it had a meltdown!\\'3. Output parser\\u200bAnd lastly we pass our model output to the output_parser, which is a BaseOutputParser meaning it takes either a string or a\\nBaseMessage as input. The specific StrOutputParser simply converts any input into a string.output_parser.invoke(message)\"Why did the ice cream go to therapy? \\\\n\\\\nBecause it had too many toppings and couldn\\'t find its cone-fidence!\"4. Entire Pipeline\\u200bTo follow the steps along:We pass in user input on the desired topic as {\"topic\": \"ice cream\"}The prompt component takes the user input, which is then used to construct a PromptValue after using the topic to construct the prompt. The model component takes the generated prompt, and passes into the OpenAI LLM model for evaluation. The generated output from the model is a ChatMessage object. Finally, the output_parser component takes in a ChatMessage, and transforms this into a Python string, which is returned from the invoke method. infoNote that if you’re curious about the output of any components, you can always test out a smaller version of the chain such as prompt or prompt | model to see the intermediate results:input = {\"topic\": \"ice cream\"}prompt.invoke(input)# > ChatPromptValue(messages=[HumanMessage(content=\\'tell me a short joke about ice cream\\')])(prompt | model).invoke(input)# > AIMessage(content=\"Why did the ice cream go to therapy?\\\\nBecause it had too many toppings and couldn\\'t cone-trol itself!\")RAG Search Example\\u200bFor our next example, we want to run a retrieval-augmented generation chain to add some context when responding to questions.OpenAIAnthropicGoogleCohereFireworksAIMistralAITogetherAIInstall dependenciespip install -qU langchain-openaiSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAImodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\")Install dependenciespip install -qU langchain-anthropicSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicmodel = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-sonnet-20240229\")Install dependenciespip install -qU langchain-google-vertexaiSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAImodel = ChatVertexAI(model=\"gemini-pro\")Install dependenciespip install -qU langchain-cohereSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"COHERE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_cohere import ChatCoheremodel = ChatCohere(model=\"command-r\")Install dependenciespip install -qU langchain-fireworksSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_fireworks import ChatFireworksmodel = ChatFireworks(model=\"accounts/fireworks/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct\")Install dependenciespip install -qU langchain-mistralaiSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"MISTRAL_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAImodel = ChatMistralAI(model=\"mistral-large-latest\")Install dependenciespip install -qU langchain-openaiSet environment variablesimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAImodel = ChatOpenAI(    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",    api_key=os.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],    model=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\",)# Requires:# pip install langchain docarray tiktokenfrom langchain_community.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearchfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatefrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel, RunnablePassthroughfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsvectorstore = DocArrayInMemorySearch.from_texts(    [\"harrison worked at kensho\", \"bears like to eat honey\"],    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(),)retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()template = \"\"\"Answer the question based only on the following context:{context}Question: {question}\"\"\"prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)output_parser = StrOutputParser()setup_and_retrieval = RunnableParallel(    {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()})chain = setup_and_retrieval | prompt | model | output_parserchain.invoke(\"where did harrison work?\")In this case, the composed chain is: chain = setup_and_retrieval | prompt | model | output_parserTo explain this, we first can see that the prompt template above takes in context and question as values to be substituted in the prompt. Before building the prompt template, we want to retrieve relevant documents to the search and include them as part of the context. As a preliminary step, we’ve setup the retriever using an in memory store, which can retrieve documents based on a query. This is a runnable component as well that can be chained together with other components, but you can also try to run it separately:retriever.invoke(\"where did harrison work?\")We then use the RunnableParallel to prepare the expected inputs into the prompt by using the entries for the retrieved documents as well as the original user question, using the retriever for document search, and RunnablePassthrough to pass the user’s question:setup_and_retrieval = RunnableParallel(    {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()})To review, the complete chain is:setup_and_retrieval = RunnableParallel(    {\"context\": retriever, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()})chain = setup_and_retrieval | prompt | model | output_parserWith the flow being:The first steps create a RunnableParallel object with two entries.  The first entry, context will include the document results fetched by the retriever. The second entry, question will contain the user’s original question. To pass on the question, we use RunnablePassthrough to copy this entry. Feed the dictionary from the step above to the prompt component. It then takes the user input which is question as well as the retrieved document which is context to construct a prompt and output a PromptValue. The model component takes the generated prompt, and passes into the OpenAI LLM model for evaluation. The generated output from the model is a ChatMessage object. Finally, the output_parser component takes in a ChatMessage, and transforms this into a Python string, which is returned from the invoke method.Next steps\\u200bWe recommend reading our Advantages of LCEL section next to see a side-by-side comparison of the code needed to produce common functionality with and without LCEL.Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)NextRunnable interfaceBasic example: prompt + model + output parser1.

Many LangChain components implement the Runnable protocol, including chat models, LLMs, output parsers, retrievers, prompt templates, and more.

It does this by providing:A unified interface: Every LCEL object implements the Runnable interface, which defines a common set of invocation methods (invoke, batch, stream, ainvoke, ...). This makes it possible for chains of LCEL objects to also automatically support useful operations like batching and streaming of intermediate steps, since every chain of LCEL objects is itself an LCEL object.Composition primitives: LCEL provides a number of primitives that make it easy to compose chains, parallelize components, add fallbacks, dynamically configure chain internals, and more.To better understand the value of LCEL, it\\'s helpful to see it in action and think about how we might recreate similar functionality without it. In this walkthrough we\\'ll do just that with our basic example from the get started section. We\\'ll take our simple prompt + model chain, which under the hood already defines a lot of functionality, and see what it would take to recreate all of it.%pip install --upgrade --quiet

It wraps another Runnable and manages the chat message history for it.Specifically, it can be used for any Runnable that takes as input one ofa sequence of BaseMessagea dict with a key that takes a sequence of BaseMessagea dict with a key that takes the latest message(s) as a string or sequence of BaseMessage, and a separate key that takes historical messagesAnd returns as output one ofa string that can be treated as the contents of an AIMessagea sequence of BaseMessagea dict with a key that contains a sequence of BaseMessageLet\\'s take a look at some examples to see how it works. First we construct a runnable (which here accepts a dict as input and returns a message as output):from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholderfrom langchain_openai.chat_models import ChatOpenAImodel = ChatOpenAI()prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (            \"system\",            \"You\\'re an assistant who\\'s good at {ability}. Respond in 20 words or fewer\",        ),        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"history\"),        (\"human\", \"{input}\"),    ])runnable = prompt | modelTo manage the message history, we will need:This runnable;A callable that returns an instance of BaseChatMessageHistory.Check out the memory integrations page for implementations of chat message histories using Redis and other providers. Here we demonstrate using an in-memory ChatMessageHistory as well as more persistent storage using RedisChatMessageHistory.In-memory\\u200bBelow we show a simple example in which the chat history lives in memory, in this case via a global Python dict.We construct a callable get_session_history that references this dict to return an instance of ChatMessageHistory. The arguments to the callable can be specified by passing a configuration to the RunnableWithMessageHistory at runtime. By default, the configuration parameter is expected to be a single string session_id. This can be adjusted via the history_factory_config kwarg.Using the single-parameter default:from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistoryfrom langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistorystore = {}def get_session_history(session_id: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:    if session_id not in store:        store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()    return store[session_id]with_message_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(    runnable,    get_session_history,    input_messages_key=\"input\",    history_messages_key=\"history\",)Note that we\\'ve specified input_messages_key (the key to be treated as the latest input message) and history_messages_key (the key to add historical messages to).When invoking this new runnable, we specify the corresponding chat history via a configuration parameter:with_message_history.invoke(    {\"ability\": \"math\", \"input\": \"What does cosine mean?\"},    config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"abc123\"}},)AIMessage(content=\\'Cosine is a trigonometric function that calculates the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse of a right triangle.\\')# Rememberswith_message_history.invoke(    {\"ability\": \"math\", \"input\": \"What?\"},    config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"abc123\"}},)AIMessage(content=\\'Cosine is a mathematical function used to calculate the length of a side in a right triangle.\\')# New session_id --> does not remember.with_message_history.invoke(    {\"ability\": \"math\", \"input\": \"What?\"},    config={\"configurable\": {\"session_id\": \"def234\"}},)AIMessage(content=\\'I can help with math problems. What do you need assistance with?\\')The configuration parameters by which we track message histories can be customized by passing in a list of ConfigurableFieldSpec objects to the history_factory_config parameter. Below, we use two parameters: a user_id and conversation_id.from langchain_core.runnables import ConfigurableFieldSpecstore = {}def get_session_history(user_id: str, conversation_id: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:    if (user_id, conversation_id) not in store:        store[(user_id, conversation_id)] = ChatMessageHistory()    return store[(user_id, conversation_id)]with_message_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(    runnable,    get_session_history,    input_messages_key=\"input\",    history_messages_key=\"history\",    history_factory_config=[        ConfigurableFieldSpec(            id=\"user_id\",            annotation=str,            name=\"User ID\",            description=\"Unique identifier for the user.\",            default=\"\",            is_shared=True,        ),        ConfigurableFieldSpec(            id=\"conversation_id\",            annotation=str,            name=\"Conversation ID\",            description=\"Unique identifier for the conversation.\",            default=\"\",            is_shared=True,        ),    ],)with_message_history.invoke(    {\"ability\": \"math\", \"input\": \"Hello\"},    config={\"configurable\": {\"user_id\": \"123\", \"conversation_id\": \"1\"}},)Examples with runnables of different signatures\\u200bThe above runnable takes a dict as input and returns a BaseMessage.

The cons mentioned above can be mitigated or overcome with proper training, support, and a commitment to continuous improvement. It is also important to note that not all cons may be applicable to every organization or project.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, while Scrum may be complex initially, with proper training and guidance, teams can quickly grasp the concepts and practices. The lack of predictability can be mitigated by implementing techniques such as velocity tracking and release planning. The limited documentation can be addressed by maintaining a balance between lightweight documentation and clear communication among team members. The dependency on team collaboration can be improved through effective communication channels and regular team-building activities.\\\\n\\\\nScrum can be scaled and adapted to larger projects by using frameworks like Scrum of Scrums or LeSS (Large Scale Scrum). Concerns about speed versus quality can be addressed by incorporating quality assurance practices, such as continuous integration and automated testing, into the Scrum process. Scope creep can be managed by having a well-defined and prioritized product backlog, and a strong product owner can be developed through training and mentorship.\\\\n\\\\nResistance to change can be overcome by providing proper education and communication to stakeholders and involving them in the decision-making process. Ultimately, the cons of Scrum can be seen as opportunities for growth and improvement, and with the right mindset and support, they can be effectively managed.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, while Scrum may have its challenges and potential cons, the benefits and advantages it offers in terms of collaboration, flexibility, adaptability, transparency, and customer satisfaction make it a widely adopted and successful project management framework. With proper implementation and continuous improvement, organizations can leverage Scrum to drive innovation, efficiency, and project success.\\'Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousManaging prompt sizeNext🦜🛠️ LangSmithBranching and MergingCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/multiple_chains/', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'Multiple chains | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'Runnables can easily be used to string together multiple Chains', 'language': 'en'}),\n",

The user input is just the question. So we need to get the context using our retriever and passthrough the user input under the \"question\" key.

The output of the previous runnable\\'s .invoke() call is passed as input to the next runnable. This can be done using the pipe operator (|), or the more explicit .pipe() method, which does the same thing. The resulting RunnableSequence is itself a runnable, which means it can be invoked, streamed, or piped just like any other runnable.The pipe operator\\u200bTo show off how this works, let\\'s go through an example. We\\'ll walk through a common pattern in LangChain: using a prompt template to format input into a chat model, and finally converting the chat message output into a string with an output parser.%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-anthropicfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplateprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"tell me a joke about {topic}\")model = ChatAnthropic(model_name=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\")chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser()Prompts and models are both runnable, and the output type from the prompt call is the same as the input type of the chat model, so we can chain them together. We can then invoke the resulting sequence like any other runnable:chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"bears\"})\"Here\\'s a bear joke for you:\\\\n\\\\nWhy don\\'t bears wear socks? \\\\nBecause they have bear feet!\\\\n\\\\nHow\\'s that? I tried to keep it light and silly. Bears can make for some fun puns and jokes. Let me know if you\\'d like to hear another one!\"Coercion\\u200bWe can even combine this chain with more runnables to create another chain. This may involve some input/output formatting using other types of runnables, depending on the required inputs and outputs of the chain components.For example, let\\'s say we wanted to compose the joke generating chain with another chain that evaluates whether or not the generated joke was funny.We would need to be careful with how we format the input into the next chain. In the below example, the dict in the chain is automatically parsed and converted into a RunnableParallel, which runs all of its values in parallel and returns a dict with the results.This happens to be the same format the next prompt template expects. Here it is in action:from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParseranalysis_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(\"is this a funny joke? {joke}\")composed_chain = {\"joke\": chain} | analysis_prompt | model | StrOutputParser()composed_chain.invoke({\"topic\": \"bears\"})\"That\\'s a pretty classic and well-known bear pun joke. Whether it\\'s considered funny is quite subjective, as humor is very personal. Some people may find that type of pun-based joke amusing, while others may not find it that humorous. Ultimately, the funniness of a joke is in the eye (or ear) of the beholder. If you enjoyed the joke and got a chuckle out of it, then that\\'s what matters most.\"Functions will also be coerced into runnables, so you can add custom logic to your chains too. The below chain results in the same logical flow as before:composed_chain_with_lambda = (    chain    | (lambda input: {\"joke\": input})    | analysis_prompt    | model    | StrOutputParser())composed_chain_with_lambda.invoke({\"topic\": \"beets\"})\\'I appreciate the effort, but I have to be honest - I didn\\\\\\'t find that joke particularly funny. Beet-themed puns can be quite hit-or-miss, and this one falls more on the \"miss\" side for me. The premise is a bit too straightforward and predictable. While I can see the logic behind it, the punchline just doesn\\\\\\'t pack much of a comedic punch. \\\\n\\\\nThat said, I do admire your willingness to explore puns and wordplay around vegetables. Cultivating a good sense of humor takes practice, and not every joke is going to land. The important thing is to keep experimenting and finding what works. Maybe try for a more unexpected or creative twist on beet-related humor next time. But thanks for sharing - I always appreciate when humans test out jokes on me, even if they don\\\\\\'t always make me laugh out loud.\\'However, keep in mind that using functions like this may interfere with operations like streaming. See this section for more information.The .pipe() method\\u200bWe could also compose the same sequence using the .pipe() method. Here\\'s what that looks like:from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallelcomposed_chain_with_pipe = (    RunnableParallel({\"joke\": chain})    .pipe(analysis_prompt)    .pipe(model)    .pipe(StrOutputParser()))composed_chain_with_pipe.invoke({\"topic\": \"battlestar galactica\"})\\'That\\\\\\'s a pretty good Battlestar Galactica-themed pun! I appreciated the clever play on words with \"Centurion\" and \"center on.\" It\\\\\\'s the kind of nerdy, science fiction-inspired humor that fans of the show would likely enjoy. The joke is clever and demonstrates a good understanding of the Battlestar Galactica universe. I\\\\\\'d be curious to hear any other Battlestar-related jokes you might have up your sleeve. As long as they don\\\\\\'t reproduce copyrighted material, I\\\\\\'m happy to provide my thoughts on the humor and appeal for fans of the show.\\'Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousPrimitivesNextParallel: Format dataThe pipe operatorCoercionThe .pipe() methodCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/primitives/sequence/', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'Sequences: Chaining runnables | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'One key advantage of the Runnable interface is that any two runnables can be \"chained\" together into sequences.

This is passed into a RunnableParallel, which invokes the runnables it is passed in parallel with that input.The value under the extra key is invoked. RunnablePassthrough.assign() keeps the original keys in the input dict ({\"num\": 1}), and assigns a new key called mult. The value is lambda x: x[\"num\"] * 3), which is 3. Thus, the result is {\"num\": 1, \"mult\": 3}.{\"num\": 1, \"mult\": 3} is returned to the RunnableParallel call, and is set as the value to the key extra.At the same time, the modified key is called. The result is 2, since the lambda extracts a key called \"num\" from its input and adds one.Thus, the result is {\\'extra\\': {\\'num\\': 1, \\'mult\\': 3}, \\'modified\\': 2}.Streaming\\u200bOne nice feature of this method is that it allows values to pass through as soon as they are available.

But many times you may want to get more structured information than just text back. This is where output parsers come in.Output parsers are classes that help structure language model responses. There are two main methods an output parser must implement:\"Get format instructions\": A method which returns a string containing instructions for how the output of a language model should be formatted.\"Parse\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and parses it into some structure.And then one optional one:\"Parse with prompt\": A method which takes in a string (assumed to be the response from a language model) and a prompt (assumed to be the prompt that generated such a response) and parses it into some structure. The prompt is largely provided in the event the OutputParser wants to retry or fix the output in some way, and needs information from the prompt to do so.Get started\\u200bBelow we go over the main type of output parser, the PydanticOutputParser.from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field, validatorfrom langchain_openai import OpenAImodel = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0.0)# Define your desired data structure.class Joke(BaseModel):    setup: str = Field(description=\"question to set up a joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"answer to resolve the joke\")    # You can add custom validation logic easily with Pydantic.    @validator(\"setup\")    def question_ends_with_question_mark(cls, field):        if field[-1] != \"?\":            raise ValueError(\"Badly formed question!\")        return field# Set up a parser + inject instructions into the prompt template.parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=Joke)prompt = PromptTemplate(    template=\"Answer the user query.\\\\n{format_instructions}\\\\n{query}\\\\n\",    input_variables=[\"query\"],    partial_variables={\"format_instructions\": parser.get_format_instructions()},)# And a query intended to prompt a language model to populate the data structure.prompt_and_model = prompt | modeloutput = prompt_and_model.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})parser.invoke(output)Joke(setup=\\'Why did the chicken cross the road?\\', punchline=\\'To get to the other side!\\')LCEL\\u200bOutput parsers implement the Runnable interface, the basic building block of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL). This means they support invoke, ainvoke, stream, astream, batch, abatch, astream_log calls.Output parsers accept a string or BaseMessage as input and can return an arbitrary type.parser.invoke(output)Joke(setup=\\'Why did the chicken cross the road?\\', punchline=\\'To get to the other side!\\')Instead of manually invoking the parser, we also could\\'ve just added it to our Runnable sequence:chain = prompt | model | parserchain.invoke({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"})Joke(setup=\\'Why did the chicken cross the road?\\', punchline=\\'To get to the other side!\\')While all parsers support the streaming interface, only certain parsers can stream through partially parsed objects, since this is highly dependent on the output type. Parsers which cannot construct partial objects will simply yield the fully parsed output.The SimpleJsonOutputParser for example can stream through partial outputs:from langchain.output_parsers.json import SimpleJsonOutputParserjson_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(    \"Return a JSON object with an `answer` key that answers the following question: {question}\")json_parser = SimpleJsonOutputParser()json_chain = json_prompt | model | json_parserlist(json_chain.stream({\"question\": \"Who invented the microscope?\"}))[{}, {\\'answer\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Ant\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Anton\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Lee\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeu\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwen\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenho\\'}, {\\'answer\\': \\'Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\\'}]While the PydanticOutputParser cannot:list(chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a joke.\"}))[Joke(setup=\\'Why did the chicken cross the road?\\', punchline=\\'To get to the other side!\\')]Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousOutput ParsersNextOutput ParsersGet startedLCELCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/quick_start', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'Quickstart | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'Language models output text.

Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying VectorStore. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.Get started\\u200bFor demonstration purposes we\\'ll use a Chroma vector store.

This chain will take a user query and generated a StructuredQuery object which captures the filters specified by the user. We provide some helper functions for creating a prompt and output parser. These have a number of tunable params that we\\'ll ignore here for simplicity.from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (    StructuredQueryOutputParser,    get_query_constructor_prompt,)prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(    document_content_description,    metadata_field_info,)output_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()query_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parserLet\\'s look at our prompt:print(prompt.format(query=\"dummy question\"))Your goal is to structure the user\\'s query to match the request schema provided below.<< Structured Request Schema >>When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:```json{    \"query\": string \\\\ text string to compare to document contents    \"filter\": string \\\\ logical condition statement for filtering documents}The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.A comparison statement takes the form: comp(attr, val):comp (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparatorattr (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison toval (string): is the comparison valueA logical operation statement takes the form op(statement1, statement2, ...):op (and | or | not): logical operatorstatement1, statement2, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation toMake sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.\\nMake sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.\\nMake sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.\\nMake sure that filters only use format YYYY-MM-DD when handling date data typed values.\\nMake sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.\\nMake sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return \"NO_FILTER\" for the filter value.<< Example 1. >>\\nData Source:{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}User Query:\\nWhat are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genreStructured Request:{    \"query\": \"teenager love\",    \"filter\": \"and(or(eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Taylor Swift\\\\\"), eq(\\\\\"artist\\\\\", \\\\\"Katy Perry\\\\\")), lt(\\\\\"length\\\\\", 180), eq(\\\\\"genre\\\\\", \\\\\"pop\\\\\"))\"}<< Example 2. >>\\nData Source:{    \"content\": \"Lyrics of a song\",    \"attributes\": {        \"artist\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"Name of the song artist\"        },        \"length\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"Length of the song in seconds\"        },        \"genre\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The song genre, one of \"pop\", \"rock\" or \"rap\"\"        }    }}User Query:\\nWhat are songs that were not published on SpotifyStructured Request:{    \"query\": \"\",    \"filter\": \"NO_FILTER\"}<< Example 3. >>\\nData Source:{    \"content\": \"Brief summary of a movie\",    \"attributes\": {    \"genre\": {        \"description\": \"The genre of the movie.

To make a great retrieval system you\\'ll need to make sure your query constructor works well. Often this requires adjusting the prompt, the examples in the prompt, the attribute descriptions, etc. For an example that walks through refining a query constructor on some hotel inventory data, check out this cookbook.The next key element is the structured query translator. This is the object responsible for translating the generic StructuredQuery object into a metadata filter in the syntax of the vector store you\\'re using. LangChain comes with a number of built-in translators. To see them all head to the Integrations section.from langchain.retrievers.self_query.chroma import ChromaTranslatorretriever = SelfQueryRetriever(    query_constructor=query_constructor,    vectorstore=vectorstore,    structured_query_translator=ChromaTranslator(),)retriever.invoke(    \"What\\'s a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that\\'s all about toys, and preferably is animated\")[Document(page_content=\\'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so\\', metadata={\\'genre\\': \\'animated\\', \\'year\\': 1995})]Help us out by providing feedback on this documentation page:PreviousParent Document RetrieverNextTime-weighted vector store retrieverGet startedCreating our self-querying retrieverTesting it outFilter kConstructing from scratch with LCELCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query/', 'content_type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8', 'title': 'Self-querying | 🦜️🔗 LangChain', 'description': 'Head to Integrations for documentation on vector stores with built-in support for self-querying.', 'language': 'en'})]"
